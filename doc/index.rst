Welcome to ProductionDemo's documentation!
---------

This package is a simple demonstration of a production machine learning package, 
from notebook to training functions with unit tests and implemented invoke service. 

The code is basic and meant to be used as a starting point for larger projects. Unit 
tests cover both logic and scripting with mocks, which should be helpful for Data Scientists 
looking to improve their unit testing skills. 

Visit the `github page <https://github.com/bshurick/production-demo>`_ for more info.
